14 Jul  2011   1. The only change in this version is a new SALFLIBC.DLL .
                  A user was installing the software on a pc ALIX1D mini with
                  XP operating system. When he tried to execute VOACAP, 
                  he got:
                  Fault code with Pointwin.exe error gives no installation(0xc000001d).
                  I downloaded a new version of SALFLIB.DLL from the compiler
                  company, and that solved his problem.
                  Let me know if this causes other problems.
