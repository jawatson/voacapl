08 Jul  2012   1. A change was made to VOACAP to test a software change
                  proposed by Alex Shovkoplyas. He believes there is an
                  indexing error in the routines curmuf, seltxr, settxr,
                  and sigdis. Using VOACAP or VOAAREA as normal, you will
                  see no difference. To activate Alex's changes,
                  change the data file:
                     ..\database\version.w32
                  to read:
                     Version 12.0708A
                  The original version of the file reads:
                     Version 12.0708W

                  The "A" will trigger Alex's changes.
