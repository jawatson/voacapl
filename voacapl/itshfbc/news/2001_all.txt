24 May  2001   1. The printing of Methods 11 & 28 in VOACAP/ICEPAC has been
                  enhanced.  Previously, if you had more than one group
                  calculated, you could only print the last group.
                  That has been fixed so that you can print out a specific
                  group or all of them.  What will happen is that all of the
                  graphs will be displayed (each window on top of the last).
                  Each window will have a menu button that says:
                       Print
                         Group #
                         All Groups
                  Where the # is replaced by the group in the window.
                  If you select "All Groups", all of the graphs will be printed.

                  You will still need to close out of all of the windows.

19 June 2001   1. A floating point error when using some HFMUFES antennas
                  has been corrected.  A specific problem of antenna type 43
                  when plotting frequencies above 12 MHz produced this error.
                  This error would also have occurred in any of the 
                  propagation calculation programs.

23 July 2001   1. There was a problem with the "SILENT" execution if you
                  are executing the VOACAPW.EXE program module.
                  It should be silent now, unless you use antenna type 90.

               2. A previous NEWS file detailed how to execute VOACAPW.EXE,
                  but there may have been a mistake in it. The error was in
                  the "pathname" parameter.
                  The proper command lines are below:
C***********************************************************************
c Execute with:
c    VOACAPW.EXE [S] directory VOACAPX.DAT VOACAPX.OUT    (P-P circuit)
c    VOACAPW.EXE [S] directory VOACAPG.DAT VOACAPG.OUT    (P-P graph)
c    VOACAPW.EXE [S] directory VOACAPD.DAT VOACAPD.OUT    (P-P distance)
c    VOACAPW.EXE [S] directory VOACAPT.DAT VOACAPT.OUT    (P-P time)
c    VOACAPW.EXE [S] directory BATCH                      (P-P batch)
c    VOACAPW.EXE [S] directory BATCH deckname.dat         (P-P NEW batch)
c    VOACAPW.EXE [S] directory BATCH deckname.dat nam.out (P-P NEW batch)
c    VOACAPW.EXE [S] directory AREA CALC VOAAREAW.CIR     (AREA batch)
c    VOACAPW.EXE [S] directory AREA method pathname       (AREA single)
c    VOACAPW.EXE [S] directory INV  CALC VOAAREAW.CIR     (AREA INVERSE batch)
c    VOACAPW.EXE [S] directory INV  method pathname       (AREA INVERSE single)
c    VOACAPW.EXE [S] directory CIRAF pathname             (CIRAF single)
c where:
c    [S]       = SILENT, then no messages are written to output window
c    directory = full pathname to the install directory (e.g. c:\ITSHFBC)
c    method    = (CALC/SCREEN/PRINT)
c    pathname  = pathname below directory\AREADATA\ of input data file
c                (e.g. DEFAULT\DEFAULT.VOA)
c

28 Aug  2001   1. There was a problem in ICEPAC Point-to-Point plotting
                  Method=28 (MUF-FOT-LUF plots).  The plots would look
                  correct on the screen, but when printed, the LUF values
                  were always those of the last group.  This has been corrected.
     
               2. A new GEO file containing the DXCC list from ARRL sorted by
                  prefix now exists in the "by City" (..\GEOCITY) directory.
                  It is named DXCC1.GEO. This was supplied by Jari from Finland.
                  (Sorry Jari, but I lost your last name.)
                  He also fixed the spelling of the cities in Finland and
                  Sweden so that they include the proper special letters.

10 Sep  2001   1. On Time plots for ICEAPC & VOACAP, if ALL Frequencies
                  was selected to plot, a fatal error could occur if you
                  selected a point very close to UT=0 for a mouse readout.
                  That problem has been fixed.

               2. A user has requested increasing the SSN limits beyond
                  250.  I have increased it to 300.  Be aware that the
                  coefficients were never developed to even exceed 150.
                  Use the results with this in mind.  It would be interesting
                  to see how the predictions match measured results at these
                  levels.

29 Nov  2001   1. A slight modification was done to the GEO files and how
                  they are displayed.

10 Dec  2001   1. VOACAP was not able to save a datafile properly if the
                  MONTH was in a MONTH.DAY format.  It always used the old
                  format where the day-of-the-month was 0.

               2. A new option was added on the DISTANCE plotting that allows
                  you to save the DISTANCE calculation to an ASCII file
                  in case you want to export the data with some other program.
                  It is found on the Menu line of the Distance plot windows.
                  It is called "ASCII file".
