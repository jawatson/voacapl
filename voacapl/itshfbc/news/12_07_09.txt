09 Jul  2012   1. I forgot about the version triggering the original IONCAP
                  absorption model. Thus:
                     Version 12.0709W = normal code
                     Version 12.0709I = use old IONCAP absorption model
                     Version 12.0709A = use Alex's changes with normal absorption
                     Version 12.0709a = use Alex's changes with IONCAP absorption

                  Remember, you need to change the data file:
                     ..\database\version.w32
