All     2004    News for NTIA/ITS HF Propagation Models (WINDOWS version)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

28 Jan  2004   1. HFANTWIN had a problem where it would not save Type 13 or 14
                  antenna types properly if you changed a parameter.
                  This has been fixed.
                  However, these antenna types are probably easier to change
                  if you use a text editor.
               2. Despite warnings during the installation, some users are
                  installing the software in directories with non-DOS names,
                  such as c:\Program Files\. Because of the software used
                  to develop these programs, that can (and will) cause problems.
                  It is best to try and use a very simple installation
                  directory. Also, if you create sub-directories under
                  ..\antennas and ..\areadata, use a name with 8 characters or less.
                  I have now added a warning when you execute any of the Point-to-Point
                  models that will detect if you installed the software in
                  a directory with a possible problem. You will get a non-fatal
                  warning message.
                  

02 Feb  2004   1. PC-Install is no longer being used for the software installation.
                  Tarma Installer is being used.
                  This should solve the problems with creating desktop icons
                  on Windows-NT/2000/XP systems.
                  PC-Install has not been supported for many years.

                  You should still be able to install the software in the same
                  directory as previous installations and only newer files
                  will be written to your system.

                  Diskette installion is not supported via Tarma Installer.
                  However, I will (for a while) continue to create
                  the diskette installion using PC-Install.

                  Please report any installion problems to me via email.

24 Mar  2004   1. Some minor modification was done for a BBC sponsor and
                  should not be noticed by anyone else.

12 Apr  2004   1. A problem existed when plotting maps with city files.
                  City names outside the specified map area were not
                  clipped and caused the map to look bad.
                  This has been fixed.

12 Oct  2004   1. A new option to plot coverages was added.
                  It is called Overlay Coverages.
                  It was funded by the BBC World Service, London.
                  It allows you to plot multiple coverages on the same map.
                  Thus, if you have coverages for 3 different frequencies and
                  wish to see what it looks like, this is a good way to do it.
                  It works for all 3 propagation models.
                  From the Area Coverage input page, just pick:
                       Run/Overlay Coverages

                  Special thanks to Ian Davey and the BBC for funding this work.

               2. Be aware that I will probably retire between Jan/April 2004.
                  I will probably still be involved with the software from home
                  as there is no one remaining to maintain the software.
