14 Nov  2014    News for NTIA/ITS HF Propagation Models (WINDOWS version)

14 Nov  2014   Let's try this again. There were problems in the last release,
               so I removed it.

               VOACAP had several problems.

               1. Method 30 (Short/Long path smoothing between 7000-10000km) was not working.
                  This was the most disturbing problem and has been fixed.

               2. There were some fatal errors during area coverage calculation.
                  Seemed to be happening with HamCap with full world calculations.
                  This has been fixed.

               3. The value of LOSS was perhaps a little wrong.
                  For each possible mode, a tranmission LOSS is calculated, and then
                  Signal Power (and Field Strength) are calculated from that.
                  Then the Most Reliable Mode (MRM) is found. The final Signal Power
                  (and Field Strength) is then calculated as the power sum of all the modes.
                  But the LOSS is given the LOSS of the MRM. Now the LOSS is back calculated
                  from the new Signal Power. Thus, it should be consistent.
                  This can be observed in Point-to-Point with Method=25.
                  The difference is small (~1dB or less).
