26 Mar  2012   1. ICEPAC had an undefined variable that could cause the
                  program to think it was in Area Coverage mode when it
                  was supposed to run in Point-to-Point mode. This appeared
                  to be a rare occurance and may be computer/operating system
                  dependent. This has been fixed. 
                  VOACAP & REC533 were not affected.
